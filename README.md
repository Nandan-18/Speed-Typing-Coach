# Speed Typing Coach

In today’s technologically advancing world, it has become essential for everyone to learn how to use computers and its functions, for even day-to-day tasks like-

• Writing important Emails

• Online Examinations

• Research papers

• Maintaining Personal Blogs

• Coding / Programming ...... and many more

What’s the most important factor common in all these tasks is the basic skill of ‘typing’ on a keyboard. 

This may sound simple but when one has got limited time on hand, learning how to type not only ‘fast’ but with good ‘accuracy’, can reduce one’s workload considerably and even provide a sense of relief and completion.

Thus, through this project, I wish to help in improving one’s typing speed and accuracy.
